## Gypsylab8 and its Mycelium Tech-milieu

### Brazilian nomadic laboratory for interspecefic relationship in the Technoscene.

On a bright afternoon on a mediterranean beach landed a bottle with a message inside.


''We need help with mycelium floating structure stop Brazil has no acces to western academic elite knowledge stop must find solution stop''


Guima San is the author of this message he is the proud dad of gypsy lab from Sao Paulo, we wrote a little story back in 2018 about his lab ([also presenting Mossdef the invisible tardigrade](https://medium.com/@BHsafari/tardigrade-invazion-inter-plannetary-invazion-and-non-human-studies-gambiologistsession-9616708d223f))

The lab is a mix of urban cryptic pixaçãos meets tropical jungle with a pinch of decolonial cosmotechnic call #Gambiarra. Gambiology is the science of repairing what's broken by using technologies that emerges from precariousness lifestyle. Gambiarra mentality is a responsible design approach toward solidarity and autonomy.

Gypsylab8 currently works on a [floating turttle that collects datas](https://youtu.be/ienOsKmb7cA) to annalyse micropastic concentration inside oceans.

Now his main focus is to replace the floating plastic parts of the tortuga with mycelium structures coated with biocomposit mixture (coagulated fibres) [we write about biomaterial since 2016](https://medium.com/@BHsafari/biodesign-and-biomaterials-2e676c92a604). 


Few mestizo prototypes are allready in the lab being tested, we hope to accelerate the research with other autonomous labs and guilds around the world. We will also set up private offgrid servers and meshnets wolrdwide to keep visible as well as invisible our maps and datas. Caravans of knowledge are allready taking off from the futur, be ready to welcome gypsylab8 in a place near you.
