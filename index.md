## Gypsylab8 and Mycelium 

### Brazilian nomadic laboratory for interspecific relationship in the Technoscene.

On a bright afternoon on a mediterranean coast landed a bottle with a message inside.


''We need help with mycelium floating structure stop Brazil has no acces to western academic elite knowledge stop everyhting looks pattented stop''


Gypsylab8 sent the message from Sao Paulo, we wrote a little story back in 2018 about his lab ([also presenting Mossdef the invisible tardigrade](https://elpaquetedigitanne.substack.com/p/tardigrade-invazion-inter-plannetary-invazion-and-non-human-studies-gambiologistsession-9616708d223f)

Gypsylab8 is a ''gambiarra'' lab with a decolonial cosmotechnic Gambiology is the science of repairing what's broken by using technics that emerges from precariousness lifestyle.

Now his main focus is to replace the floating plastic parts of the tortuga with mycelium structures coated with biocomposit mixture (coagulated fibres) [we write about biomaterial since 2016](https://medium.com/@BHsafari/biodesign-and-biomaterials-2e676c92a604).

Soon gypsylab will be on the road for workshops
