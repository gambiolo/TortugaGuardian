## Gypsylab8 and Mycelium 

### Brazilian nomadic laboratory for interspecific relationship in the Technoscene.

On a bright afternoon on a mediterranean coast landed a bottle with a message inside.


''We need help with mycelium floating structure stop Brazil has no acces to western academic elite knowledge stop need help stop''


Gypsylab8 sent the message from Sao Paulo, we wrote a little story back in 2018 about his lab ([also presenting Mossdef the invisible tardigrade](https://medium.com/@BHsafari/tardigrade-invazion-inter-plannetary-invazion-and-non-human-studies-gambiologistsession-9616708d223f))

The lab is a mix of urban cryptic pixaçãos meets tropical jungle with a pinch of decolonial cosmotechnic call #Gambiarra. Gambiology is the science of repairing what's broken by using technics that emerges from precariousness lifestyle. Gambiarra is a form of responsible design toward solidarity and autonomy.

Gypsylab8 currently works on a [floating turttle that collects datas](https://youtu.be/ienOsKmb7cA) to annalyse micropastic concentration from the ocean.

Now his main focus is to replace the floating plastic parts of the tortuga with mycelium structures coated with biocomposit mixture (coagulated fibres) [we write about biomaterial since 2016](https://medium.com/@BHsafari/biodesign-and-biomaterials-2e676c92a604).


Some prototypes are allready in the lab being tested, we hope to accelerate the research with other autonomous labs and guilds around the world. We will also set up servers to host our maps and data sets.
